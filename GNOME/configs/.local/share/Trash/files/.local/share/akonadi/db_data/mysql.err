160205 21:37:17 [Note] InnoDB: Reading tablespace information from the .ibd files...
160205 21:37:17 [ERROR] InnoDB: Attempted to open a previously opened tablespace. Previous tablespace akonadi/collectiontable uses space ID: 3 at filepath: ./akonadi/collectiontable.ibd. Cannot open tablespace mysql/gtid_slave_pos which uses space ID: 3 at filepath: ./mysql/gtid_slave_pos.ibd
2016-02-05 21:37:17 7ff8e130a740  InnoDB: Operating system error number 2 in a file operation.
InnoDB: The error means the system cannot find the path specified.
InnoDB: If you are installing InnoDB, remember that you must create
InnoDB: directories yourself, InnoDB does not create them.
InnoDB: Error: could not open single-table tablespace file ./mysql/gtid_slave_pos.ibd
InnoDB: We do not continue the crash recovery, because the table may become
InnoDB: corrupt if we cannot apply the log records in the InnoDB log to it.
InnoDB: To fix the problem and start mysqld:
InnoDB: 1) If there is a permission problem in the file and mysqld cannot
InnoDB: open the file, you should modify the permissions.
InnoDB: 2) If the table is not needed, or you can restore it from a backup,
InnoDB: then you can remove the .ibd file, and InnoDB will do a normal
InnoDB: crash recovery and ignore that table.
InnoDB: 3) If the file system or the disk is broken, and you cannot remove
InnoDB: the .ibd file, you can set innodb_force_recovery > 0 in my.cnf
InnoDB: and force InnoDB to continue crash recovery here.
