The default is ` * `, but if you want comments to look like this instead:\n\n```\n/*\n + Hello World!\n + This is my comment.\n */\n```\n\nthen change the Mid String setting to ` + `.  \nDon't forget to add a space before and after the character you want to use, as in '\\_+\\_'. Otherwise, you'll wind up with comments looking like the following:\n\n```\n/*\n+Hello World!\n+This is my ugly comment.\n+I forgot to add a space before and after\n+the '+' character in the Mid String setting.\n */\n```\n","readmeFilename":"README.md","bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/ibykow/info-comment/issues"},"homepage":"https://github.com/ibykow/info-comment#readme","_id":"info-comment@0.1.1","_shasum":"f26ea0922ea7d586c0ac1535df368e7cf9f31504","_resolved":"file:../d-116120-23691-lm4atx/package.tgz","_from":"../d-116120-23691-lm4atx/package.tgz"}
