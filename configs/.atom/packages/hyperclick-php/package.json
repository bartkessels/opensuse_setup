Inspired by [js-hyperclick](https://github.com/AsaAyers/js-hyperclick).\nHyperclick package is required.\n\n### Usage\n`<cmd-click>` on a supported word to jump it's declaration or location.\n\n### Features\n* **Variables**: jump to their last definition in current file.\n* **Required/Included Files**: open file in new pane, or - if already open - jump to it's pane in editor.\n* Will attempt to resolve **included files** in current directory, then parent directories, until project root is reached\n* **Functions**: jump to their definition in the current file.\n\n### Known Issues\n* originally designed to handle a morass of procedural code (ie not object definitions)\n* only works for variables & functions defined in the current file\n* array references/definitions don't work\n* pays no attention to scope or if a variable was defined as part of function prototype\n* probably won't work with object instance variables\n\nso ... to reiterate: *very* simple\n",
